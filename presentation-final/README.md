# Final presentation

Even though there is a _.pdf_ file generated for this presentation (it's in this folder, called _final\_presentation.pdf_), it can be viewed very easily by following these commands:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

You will be redirected to _localhost:3030_ or some other address in case port _3030_ is unavailable. To switch on the presenter mode, press _F_.
