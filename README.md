The instructions on how to run it are in the folder.

## Portfolio. Element 2

The second element of the portfolio is mountains generation using L-Systems. It is based on the paper by Ashlock, D. et al: [Evolution of L-systems for compact virtual landscape generation](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-axiom-and-rules-for-a-simple-two-dimensional-L-system-together-with-two-expansion-of_fig1_221007670). The documentation is also there under _music-documentation.pdf_ name.

More can be found in _presentation-final/final-presentation.pdf_.

## Midterm Presentation

The source code for the midterm presentation can be found in _./presentation/_. It contains description of two portfolio elements with funny images. For unknown reason there was no way to export it as _.pdf_. Therefore, if there is a need to run it, the instructions can be found in the folder.

## Final Presentation

The source code for the final presentation can be found in _./presentation-final_. It contains final description of two portfolio elements with funny images (even more than in the midterm presentation!) and the final project. The _.pdf_ can be found in the same folder under the name _final-presentation.pdf_.
